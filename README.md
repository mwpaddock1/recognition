Recognition

The Employee to Employee Recognition Program

Aligning employee interests with corporate goals can help further those goals. This is an application where employees give recognition to their peers for actions that support the corporate goals. This application can be customized to reflect the goals of any corporation.

Future iterations could include a method for employees to redeem recognition points for gift cards or swag.
